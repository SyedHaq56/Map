      <p style="border:15px; border-style:solid; border-color:white; padding: 2em;">New York is home to 1.7 million Jews, the most in the United States of America, with the least being in South Dakota with around 250 as per world population review.
        The number of Jews in New York alone exceeds the population of Tel Aviv (435,855) and Jerusalem (874,186). "Because of the diversity in New York, there is less anti-Semistism," said Marc Greenberg, the Director of the Interfaith Assembly on
        Homelessness and Housing. Greenberg is a Jewish resident in NYC who along with volunteers of other religions advocate for shelters for the homeless. One of the other reason he believes is the historic immigration of Jews in the late 1800s to
        early 1900s when Jews migrated from Eastern Europe to Lower-East Brooklyn. He said many of the Jews historically always had or has a family member or ancestor who lived in Brooklyn.
